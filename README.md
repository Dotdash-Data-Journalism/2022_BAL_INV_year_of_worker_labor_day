# Year of Worker Labor Market Recovery Story for The Balance and Investopedia

This repository contains the code and data behind the labor market recovery stories run on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/the-u-s-labor-market-recovery-in-charts-6541384) and [The Balance](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/29-months-later-all-the-jobs-lost-to-covid-19-are-back-6542485) ahead of Labor Day 2022. The R file `year_of_worker_labor_day_analysis.R`
will download data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [Current Employment Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ces/data/), [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/data.htm), [Employment Cost Index](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ect/data.htm), and [Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) surveys and will produce the CSVs used to create the [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/) visualizations in both articles in the `visualizations` folder. Also needed to run the R analysis script is a CSV of [NBER recessionary periods by month](https://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions) available for download from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USREC) in the `reference_files` folder. Slight differences may be present between the final data produced by the R file and the data in article charts due to [BLS revisions](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-2/revisions-to-jobs-numbers.htm) of July 2022 data that was preliminary as of article publication in September of 2022.
